# Self-driving-deep-learning
Built a fully functional self-driving car fuelled entirely by Deep Learning. Used pre-processing images, data augmentation and also trained the model to detect various traffic signs and predict the steering angle by looking the lane.
The car was first trained by normal human driving on a simulator provided by Udacity. The simulator can be downloaded from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim.
Using Behavioural Cloning the car was tested on different track and performed efficiently.
